/*
 * hal_uart.h
 *
 * Thin wrapper over FSP's r_sci_uart driver (g_uart_qe / SCI9 on P109 TX / P110 RX)
 * dedicated to the Tuya Wi-Fi module link. SCI1 (g_uart1 on P212 RX / P213 TX) is dedicated
 * to text debug logging via app_log.c.
 *
 * When QE_TUNNING_TESTING is enabled (1), g_uart_qe routes its callback to QE Touch tuning.
 * When QE_TUNNING_TESTING is disabled (0), g_uart_qe routes its callback to Tuya MCU SDK.
 *
 * RX uses UART_EVENT_RX_CHAR (byte-by-byte, no prior length known) -- each received byte
 * lands in a small ring buffer, and tuya_uart_thread_entry.c drains it after waking on
 * g_uart_rx_semaphore.
 *
 * TX has both blocking and non-blocking entry points.
